        At Bits of Good, I've worked as a developer for Boys and Girls Club for
        Metro Atlanta (BGCMA) and Fair Districts GA. For BGCMA, we continued
        working on a bus safety web app to track student attendance on buses.
        For Fair Districts GA, we made a web app to link volunteers of the
        nonprofit with state legislators and newspapers, simplifying their
        process for reaching out to these entities.
